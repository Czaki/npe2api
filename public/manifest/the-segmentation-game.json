This allows comparing binary segmentation algorithms, such as thresholding techniques.\n* Jaccard Index (binary, sparse): The annotated ground truth image can contain values 1 (negative, false) and 2 (positive, true) and\n  the segmentation result image will be binarized (0: False, otherwise: True). This allows comparing object/no-object annotations with label images.\n\n## Related plugins\n\nIf you aim at automatically optimizing segmentation quality, there are also napari plugins available with this capability:\n\n* [napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification)\n* [napari-workflow-optimizer](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-workflow-optimizer)\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install `the-segmentation-game` via [pip]:\n\n    pip install the-segmentation-game\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions - especially new image segmentation quality metrics - are very welcome.
