It can be rotated, translated, deformed, and with a wider field of view. \nThen the calculated transformation is applied to all the other chanels for each stack.\nThe final result is a multi-chanel 3D stack.\n\nThe common chanel can be averaged between the different chanels, which improves its quality.\n\n\n----------------------------------\n## Installation\n\nYou can install `multireg` via [pip]:\n\n    pip install multireg\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can launch `multireg` in napari by going to `Plugins>multireg: do multiplex registration`.\n\n### Fixed image\nIt will open a prompt to ask you to select the reference (fixed) image, compared to which all other images will be aligned.\nThen you have to choose the reference chanel that will be used in all the stacks to calculate the alignement. So this chanel should be common to all stacks.\n\n### Reference points\nThe first part of the registration relies on reference points manually selected, because the common field of view can be quite far from each other in the acquisition. So first a affine registration is applied to bring close the region of interest between the two stacks to match.\n\nYou have to manually placed a few reference points (4-5 should be enough). Try to spread them in the image (in x,y and z) on landmarks to recognize them in other images. \n\nTo add a new reference point, click on the \"plus\" sign in the left panel. To select one, click on the arrow icon (or press 3), then on the point. You can move the point in x and y. To move it in z, press 'u' for up and 'd' for down. \nWhen all points are placed, save them.\n\n\n### Moving image\nThen you can choose one of the images you want to align with the reference image.\n\n\n\n## License\n\nDistributed under the terms of the [BSD-3] license,\n\"multireg\" is free and open source software\n\n## Plugin initialization\nThis [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.\n\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you encounter any problems, please [file an issue] along with a detailed description.\n\n[napari]: https://github.com/napari/napari\n[Cookiecutter]: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter\n[@napari]: https://github.com/napari\n[MIT]: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[BSD-3]: http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause\n[GNU GPL v3.0]: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt\n[GNU LGPL v3.0]: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.txt\n[Apache Software License 2.0]: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n[Mozilla Public License 2.0]: https://www.mozilla.org/media/MPL/2.0/index.txt\n[cookiecutter-napari-plugin]: https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin\n\n[napari]: https://github.com/napari/napari\n[tox]: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n[pip]: https://pypi.org/project/pip/\n[PyPI]: https://pypi.org/\n",
