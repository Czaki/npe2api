This has mainly two advantages when visualizing in 3D:\n\n1. We don't have to load the whole data into memory\n2. The surrounding objects won't occlude the annotated ones, making it easier to check the annotation.\n\nBounding boxes can be created from the `Object list` widget. The dimensionality of the bounding box layer will be determined from the image layer. As bounding boxes are created, a small thumbnail will be displayed.\n\nThe proposed pipeline goes as follows:\n\n 1. Create a bounding box layer\n 2. Select data parts using the bounding boxes\n 3. Select an object from the object list\n 4. Annotate the object\n 5. Repeat from 3.\n\n### Slice interpolation\nThe `Interpolation` tab contains tools for estimating missing annotation slices from existing ones. Two methods are implemented:\n * Geometric: the interpolation will be determined by calculating the average of the corresponding contour points.\n * RSPV: A more sophisticated average contour calculation, see the preprint [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.02823.pdf).\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36735863/188876826-1771acee-93ba-4905-982e-bfb459329659.mp4\n\n### Minimal contour\nThis plugin can estimate a minimal contour, which is calculated from a point set on the edges of the object, which are provided by the user. This contour will follow some image feature (pixels with high gradient or high/low intensity).\nFeatures:\n * With a single click a new point can be added to the set. This will also extend the contour with the curve shown in red\n * A double click will close the curve by adding both the red and gray curves to the minimal contour\n * When holding `Shift`, the gray and red highlight will be swapped, so the other curve can be added to the contour\n * With the `Ctrl` button down a straight line can be added instead of the minimal path\n * If the anchor points were misplaced, the last point can be removed by right-clicking, or the whole point set can be cleared by pressing `Esc`\n * The `Param` value at the widget will decide, how strongly should the contour follow edges on the image. Higher value means higher sensitivity to image data, while a lower value will be closer to straight lines.\n * Different features can be used, like image gradient or pixel intensities, and also user-defined features (using Python)\n   * the image is accessed as the `image` variable, and the features should be stored in the `features` variable in the small code editor widget\n\nThis functionality can be used by selecting the `Minimal Contour` tab in the `Annotation Toolbox` widget, which will create a new layer called `Anchors`.\n\n**Important note: Do not remove or modify this layer directly!**\n\n*Note: if any layer is created before opening the `Annotation Toolbox` widget, some \"temporary\" layers appear in the layer list. This is not intended, but currently there is no way to hide these. __Do not remove or modify these, as this could break the plugin!__ Whenever possible, open the toolbox first, in order to prevent these from appearing.*\n\n#### Intensity-based:\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36735863/191023482-0dfafb5c-003a-47f6-a21b-8582a4e3930f.mp4\n\n#### Gradient-based:\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36735863/191024941-f20f63a0-8281-47d2-be22-d1ec34fe1f5d.mp4\n\n#### Custom feature:\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36735863/191025028-3f807bd2-1f2e-40d2-800b-48af820a7dbe.mp4\n\n## License\n\nDistributed under the terms of the [BSD-3] license,\n\"napari-nD-annotator\" is free and open source software\n\n## Issues\n\n### Known issues\n * When using the `Annotation Toolbox`:\n   * When deleting a single layer from the layer list, some other layers' names might be overwritten by some \"invisible\" utility layers. Selecting and unselecting these will restore the original layer.\n   * When deleting multiple layers, some strange behavior can happen (layer duplicates appear, only in the layer list; napari breaks etc.). Until fixed, layers should be removed one by one.\n   * If any layer is created before opening the `Annotation Toolbox` widget, some \"temporary\" layers appear in the layer list.
