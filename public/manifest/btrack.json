Follow the [instructions on our developer guide](https://btrack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev_guide).\n\n\n---\n### Citation\n\nMore details of how this type of tracking approach can be applied to tracking cells in time-lapse microscopy data can be found in the following publications:\n\n**Automated deep lineage tree analysis using a Bayesian single cell tracking approach**  \nUlicna K, Vallardi G, Charras G and Lowe AR.  \n*Front in Comp Sci* (2021)  \n[![doi:10.3389/fcomp.2021.734559](https://img.shields.io/badge/doi-10.3389%2Ffcomp.2021.734559-blue)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fcomp.2021.734559)\n\n\n**Local cellular neighbourhood controls proliferation in cell competition**  \nBove A, Gradeci D, Fujita Y, Banerjee S, Charras G and Lowe AR.  \n*Mol.
