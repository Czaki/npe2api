APIs are likely to change before it's first 0.0.1 release,\nbut feedback and contributions are welcome.\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can clone this repository with install locally with\n\n    pip install -e .\n\n## Examples\nExamples can be found in our [examples](examples) folder. Simple examples for both interactive and headless \nuse of the plugin follow.\n\n### Interactive\n**napari-animation** can be used interactively by creating an `AnimationWidget` from a napari `Viewer` and adding it to\nthe viewer as a dock widget.\n\n```python\nfrom napari_animation import AnimationWidget\n\nanimation_widget = AnimationWidget(viewer)\nviewer.window.add_dock_widget(animation_widget, area='right')\n```\n\n![AnimationWidget image](resources/screenshot-animation-widget.png)\n\n### Headless\n**napari-animation** can also be run headless, allowing for reproducible, scripted creation of animations.\n\n```python\nfrom napari_animation import Animation\n\nanimation = Animation(viewer)\n\nviewer.dims.ndisplay = 3\nviewer.camera.angles = (0.0, 0.0, 90.0)\nanimation.capture_keyframe()\nviewer.camera.zoom = 2.4\nanimation.capture_keyframe()\nviewer.camera.angles = (-7.0, 15.7, 62.4)\nanimation.capture_keyframe(steps=60)\nviewer.camera.angles = (2.0, -24.4, -36.7)\nanimation.capture_keyframe(steps=60)\nviewer.reset_view()\nviewer.camera.angles = (0.0, 0.0, 90.0)\nanimation.capture_keyframe()\nanimation.animate('demo.mov', canvas_only=False)\n```\n\n## Is everything animate-able?\n\nUnfortunately, not yet! Currently differences in the following objects are tracked by the `Animation` class\n\n- `Viewer.camera`\n- `Viewer.dims`\n- `Layer.scale`\n- `Layer.translate`\n- `Layer.rotate`\n- `Layer.shear`\n- `layer.opacity`\n- `Layer.blending`\n- `Layer.visible`\n\nSupport for more layer attributes will be added in future releases.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome. Tests and additional infrastructure are being setup.\n\n## License\n\nDistributed under the terms of the [BSD-3] license,\n\"napari-animation\" is free and open source software\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you encounter any problems, please [file an issue] along with a detailed description.\n\n[napari]: https://github.com/napari/napari\n[Cookiecutter]: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter\n[@napari]: https://github.com/napari\n[BSD-3]: http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause\n[cookiecutter-napari-plugin]: https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin\n[file an issue]: https://github.com/sofroniewn/napari-animation/issues\n[napari]: https://github.com/napari/napari\n[tox]: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n[pip]: https://pypi.org/project/pip/\n[PyPI]: https://pypi.org/\n\n\n",
