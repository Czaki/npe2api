This will create a new image layer with the 3D PSF.\n \n   The option `Show Airy disk` creates 3 ellipses in a Shapes layer, showing the boundaries of the diffraction limited blob.\n\n![raw](https://github.com/andreabassi78/napari-psf-simulator/raw/main/images/figure.png)\n**Napari viewer with the psf-simulator widget showing the in-focus plane of an aberrated PSF**\n\n![raw](https://github.com/andreabassi78/napari-psf-simulator/raw/main/images/animation.gif)\n**Slicing through a PSF aberrated with Zernike polynomials of order N=3, M=1 (coma)**\n\n3) Click on the `Plot PSF Profile in Console` checkbox to see the x and z profiles of the PSF.\n   They will show up in  the viewer console when `Calculate PSF` is executed.\n\n![raw](https://github.com/andreabassi78/napari-psf-simulator/raw/main/images/Plot.png)\n**Plot profile of the PSF, shown in the Console**\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome. Tests can be run with [tox], please ensure\nthe coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request. \nThe plugin has been concived to be modular allowing the insertion of new aberations and pupils. Please contact the developers on github for adding new propagations and aberrations types. \nAny suggestions or contributions are welcome.\n\n## License\n\nDistributed under the terms of the [BSD-3] license,\n\"napari-psf-simulator\" is free and open source software\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you encounter any problems, please [file an issue] along with a detailed description.\n\n[napari]: https://github.com/napari/napari\n[Cookiecutter]: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter\n[@napari]: https://github.com/napari\n[MIT]: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[BSD-3]: http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause\n[GNU GPL v3.0]: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt\n[GNU LGPL v3.0]: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.txt\n[Apache Software License 2.0]: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n[Mozilla Public License 2.0]: https://www.mozilla.org/media/MPL/2.0/index.txt\n[cookiecutter-napari-plugin]: https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin\n\n[file an issue]: https://github.com/andreabassi78/napari-psf-simulator/issues\n\n[napari]: https://github.com/napari/napari\n[tox]: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n[pip]: https://pypi.org/project/pip/\n[PyPI]: https://pypi.org/\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "keywords": null, "home_page": "https://github.com/andreabassi78/napari-psf-simulator", "download_url": null, "author": "Andrea Bassi", "author_email": "andrea1.bassi@polimi.it", "maintainer": null, "maintainer_email": null, "license": "BSD-3-Clause", "classifier": ["Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "Intended Audience :: Developers", "Framework :: napari", "Topic :: Software Development :: Testing", "Programming Language :: Python", "Programming Language :: Python :: 3", "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.8", "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.9", "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.10", "Operating System :: OS Independent", "License :: OSI Approved :: BSD License"], "requires_dist": ["numpy", "magicgui", "qtpy", "tox ; extra == 'testing'", "pytest ; extra == 'testing'", "pytest-cov ; extra == 'testing'", "pytest-qt ; extra == 'testing'", "napari ; extra == 'testing'", "pyqt5 ; extra == 'testing'"], "requires_python": ">=3.8", "requires_external": null, "project_url": ["Bug Tracker, https://github.com/andreabassi78/napari-psf-simulator/issues", "Documentation, https://github.com/andreabassi78/napari-psf-simulator#README.md", "Source Code, https://github.com/andreabassi78/napari-psf-simulator", "User Support, https://github.com/andreabassi78/napari-psf-simulator/issues"], "provides_extra": ["testing"], "provides_dist": null, "obsoletes_dist": null}, "npe1_shim": false}
